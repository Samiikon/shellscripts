# Shell scripts

This is just a repo to store any scripts I have written.

### dpc

Delete PyCache - Deletes pycache folder in current directory, if one exists.

### puu

Shortcut for using `tree` command with `-L` flag. Takes display depth of directory tree as first argument e.g. `puu 2`. 

_Puu means tree in finnish._

### huu

Same as `puu`, but also shows hidden files.
